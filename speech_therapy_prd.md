# Speech Therapy Web App - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

### Product Vision
A Next.js web application that bridges the gap between speech therapists and parents by providing a centralized platform for session management, progress tracking, and seamless communication focused on improving therapy outcomes for children.

### Problem Statement
Current speech therapy workflows lack efficient digital tools that:
- Enable parents to easily track their child's progress between sessions
- Provide clear communication channels between therapists and parents
- Organize session materials, homework, and payment tracking in one place
- Give parents visibility into what happens during therapy sessions

### Solution Overview
Our MVP delivers a dual-interface platform: a parent-focused dashboard centered around a visual "Journey Board" showing therapy progress, and an admin dashboard for therapists to manage students, sessions, and communications.

### Success Metrics
- **Parent Engagement**: 80% weekly active parent users
- **Session Completion**: 95% of assigned homework completed
- **Communication**: Average response time <24 hours between parents and therapists
- **User Satisfaction**: 4.5+ star rating from parent feedback
