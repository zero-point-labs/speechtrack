# üöÄ Cloudflare R2 Migration - Implementation Complete

## üéâ **What's Been Implemented**

Your speech therapy project is now ready for migration from Appwrite Storage to Cloudflare R2! Here's what has been set up:

---

## üì¶ **New Files Created**

### **Scripts (Phase 0-3)**
- `scripts/inventory-files.js` - Analyzes current Appwrite storage
- `scripts/backup-appwrite-files.js` - Creates complete backup with integrity checks
- `scripts/migrate-to-r2.js` - Migrates files from Appwrite to R2
- `scripts/verify-migration.js` - Verifies migration completeness and integrity
- `scripts/setup-r2.js` - Tests R2 configuration and readiness

### **Services**
- `lib/fileServiceR2.js` - Cloudflare R2 file service (same interface as Appwrite)
- `lib/fileServiceHybrid.js` - Smart service that switches between Appwrite and R2
- `app/api/file-proxy-hybrid/[fileId]/route.js` - Hybrid file serving (supports both storage types)

### **Updated Files**
- `package.json` - Added AWS SDK dependencies and R2 npm scripts
- `scripts/setup-env.js` - Added R2 environment variables template

---

## üîß **Environment Variables Added**

The following variables have been added to your environment template:

```env
# Cloudflare R2 Storage Configuration
CLOUDFLARE_R2_ENDPOINT=your-r2-endpoint-here
CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-r2-access-key-here
CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-r2-secret-key-here
CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET_NAME=speechtrack-session-files

# Storage Feature Toggles
USE_R2_STORAGE=false
ENABLE_MIXED_STORAGE_MODE=false
```

---

## üö¶ **Migration Process - Step by Step**

### **Phase 1: Setup & Configuration**

1. **Get Cloudflare R2 credentials:**
   - Go to Cloudflare Dashboard ‚Üí R2 Object Storage
   - Create API token with R2 permissions
   - Create bucket: `speechtrack-session-files`
   - Note down endpoint, access key, secret key

2. **Update environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Edit your .env.local file
   CLOUDFLARE_R2_ENDPOINT=https://YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
   CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
   CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
   CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET_NAME=speechtrack-session-files
   ```

3. **Test R2 setup:**
   ```bash
   npm run r2-setup
   ```

### **Phase 2: Backup & Inventory**

4. **Create file inventory:**
   ```bash
   npm run r2-inventory
   ```

5. **Backup all files:**
   ```bash
   npm run r2-backup
   ```
   *This creates local backup in `backups/` directory*

### **Phase 3: Migration**

6. **Migrate files to R2:**
   ```bash
   npm run r2-migrate
   ```
   *Migrates files in batches with progress tracking*

7. **Verify migration:**
   ```bash
   npm run r2-verify
   ```
   *Compares files between Appwrite and R2*

### **Phase 4: Testing & Cutover**

8. **Test with mixed mode (optional):**
   ```env
   ENABLE_MIXED_STORAGE_MODE=true
   ```
   *This allows reading from both storage types*

9. **Enable R2 as primary storage:**
   ```env
   USE_R2_STORAGE=true
   ```

10. **Test application thoroughly:**
    - Upload new files
    - View existing files
    - Download files
    - Test from both admin and parent dashboards

## üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Features Built-In**

### **Backup Protection**
- Complete local backup before migration
- Checksums for file integrity verification
- Resumable migration (won't re-migrate existing files)

### **Rollback Capability**
- Feature toggles allow instant rollback
- Original Appwrite files remain untouched during migration
- Hybrid service can serve from both storage types

### **Error Handling**
- Comprehensive error logging
- Failed migrations can be retried
- Progress tracking with detailed reports

## üìä **Migration Scripts Overview**

| Script | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `r2-setup` | Test R2 configuration | Before migration |
| `r2-inventory` | Analyze current files | Planning phase |
| `r2-backup` | Create safety backup | Before migration |
| `r2-migrate` | Move files to R2 | Migration phase |
| `r2-verify` | Check migration success | After migration |

## üîÑ **How the Hybrid System Works**

The hybrid file service automatically detects storage type:

- **Appwrite files**: Simple ID format (e.g., `abc123`)
- **R2 files**: Path format (e.g., `session123/file456_document.pdf`)
- **API routes**: Accept `?storage=appwrite` or `?storage=r2` parameter for explicit control

### **File URL Examples:**
```
# Appwrite file
/api/file-proxy/abc123?action=view

# R2 file  
/api/file-proxy-hybrid/session123/file456_document.pdf?action=view

# Explicit storage type
/api/file-proxy-hybrid/abc123?storage=appwrite&action=download
```

## üí∞ **Expected Cost Savings**

Current Appwrite storage is hitting the 2GB limit. With R2:

- **10GB**: ~$0.15/month (vs. Appwrite paid plan)
- **100GB**: ~$1.50/month 
- **1TB**: ~$15.00/month
- **Egress**: FREE (major advantage over other providers)

**Break-even**: Almost immediate
**Annual savings**: $100-500+ depending on growth

## üö® **Important Notes**

### **Before You Start**
1. **Test in development first** - Don't run on production without testing
2. **Verify backups** - Make sure backup script completes successfully
3. **R2 bucket must exist** - Create it in Cloudflare dashboard first
4. **Dependencies installed** - npm install should complete without errors

### **During Migration**
1. **Monitor progress** - Migration scripts show detailed progress
2. **Don't interrupt** - Let migration complete or files may be in inconsistent state
3. **Check logs** - All scripts create detailed log files

### **After Migration**
1. **Test thoroughly** - Verify file uploads, downloads, and viewing
2. **Monitor performance** - R2 should be faster than Appwrite
3. **Keep backups** - Don't delete Appwrite files immediately

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**"Missing environment variables"**
- Update your `.env.local` with R2 credentials
- Run `npm run r2-setup` to verify configuration

**"Bucket does not exist"**
- Create the bucket in Cloudflare R2 dashboard
- Ensure bucket name matches `CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET_NAME`

**"Migration failed"**
- Check error logs in generated migration report
- Re-run `npm run r2-migrate` to retry failed files
- Ensure R2 API credentials have write permissions

**"Files not loading after cutover"**
- Check `USE_R2_STORAGE` environment variable
- Verify R2 URLs are being generated correctly
- Test with mixed mode first: `ENABLE_MIXED_STORAGE_MODE=true`
